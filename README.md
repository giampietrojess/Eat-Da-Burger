# Bob's Burgers: Burger of the Day!

## Summary
A Burger App with a Bob's Burgers Theme that allows the users to choose a burger type, then displays their choice on the left side of the screen with an option to devour it. When the Devour button is clicked, it moves the burger to the right, giving an option to 'remove'. Burgers are stored in a MySQL database. The App was created using Node Express Handlebars and a custom ORM. It uses the MVC design pattern, Node and MySQL to query and route data to the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
